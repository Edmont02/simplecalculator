I am currently implementing a simple calculator program in the language C!

Here are my system requirements/needs assessment for this project:
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: Ability to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Decimal Point: To handle calculations with decimal numbers.
3. User Interface: Prompt user to give operands and operators.
4. Error handling: Check that user input is valid and that no rules of division, etc., are broken.

My goal is to have a functioning simple calculator by October 3rd, 2025.
