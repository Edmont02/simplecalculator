2. Percentage Calculation: To calculate percentages easily.
4. Decimal Point: To handle calculations with decimal numbers.
5. Clear Function (complete erase): To clear the display and previous entries.
6. Clear Button (change recent/current input): To clear the most recent entry.
7. Square Root Function: Take the square root of a number
